The OpenFCA Project comprises a set of tools for Formal Concept Analysis, such as context creation, lattice visualization and attribute exploration.

The springraph/ directory contains a modified version of the SpringGraph component (http://mark-shepherd.com/blog/springgraph-flex-component/), which was created by Mark Shepherd and is provided under a separate component license (see springgraph/component_license.htm).

The rest of the project is provided under an MIT-style license (see LICENSE.txt).

The project authors are Paul-Valentin Borza, Ovidiu Sabou and Cosmin Coman.

=About=
This project contains three modules:
 * Conflexplore, a Flex application used for context editing, concept computation and visualization, implication computation and attribute exploration;
 * a heavily modified version of [http://mark-shepherd.com/blog/springgraph-flex-component/ SpringGraph], which is a [http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/ Flex] component for displaying a set of items that are linked to each other;
 * Conexplore, a C#/.NET set of tools for computing concepts and links between them on large datasets.
Conflexplore and the modified version of SpringGraph are Flash Builder 4 projects based on Flex 4.0 SDK: [ScreenShots screenshots.]

=Documentation=
[Guide This page] contains a simple user guide for the _Conflexplore_ application.
