# About #
This project contains three modules:
  * Conflexplore, a Flex application used for context editing, concept computation and visualization, implication computation and attribute exploration;
  * a heavily modified version of [SpringGraph](http://mark-shepherd.com/blog/springgraph-flex-component/), which is a [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) component for displaying a set of items that are linked to each other;
  * Conexplore, a C#/.NET set of tools for computing concepts and links between them on large datasets.
Conflexplore and the modified version of SpringGraph are Flash Builder 4 projects based on Flex 4.0 SDK: [screenshots.](ScreenShots.md)
